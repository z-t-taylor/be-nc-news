# Northcoders News API

## About 
This is part one, the backend service, of a two-part project. The architecture takes inspiration from the structure of such platforms as Reddit.

The project's purpose is to facilitate a client-server relationship through a RESTful API. The idea is that data is accessed programmatically through client requests to the server. 


## Instructions
I am aware that this would not be the norm, but to showcase this project, these steps must be followed by anyone wishing to clone this repo and fully see the code structure.
